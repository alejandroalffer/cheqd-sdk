libvcx (0.11.2) unstable; urgency=medium

[ Hyperledger ]

## 0.11.2
* Bugfixes
    * Provisioning with token does not work after its enforcing (disabling of old provisioning protocol) on the Agency side.

## 0.11.1
* Minor bugfix

## 0.11.0
* IMPORTANT CHANGE: Default `protocol_type` has been changed from `1.0` to `3.0`. It means that we are using Aries by default now.
* Added Proof Proposal functionality:
    * Added `vcx_disclosed_proof_create_proposal` function that starts presentation protocol from a proposal
    * Added `vcx_disclosed_proof_send_proposal` function that sends a proposal through connection
    * Added `vcx_proof_request_proof` function that sends a proof request in response with new data
    * Added `vcx_get_proof_proposal` function that returns proof proposal object
* Supported Ephemeral Proof Request via `~request-attach`:
    * Added `vcx_proof_get_request_attach` function that generates request attachment from a proof protocol instance.
    * Added `vcx_proof_set_connection` function that sets the connection for proof request that was send along with OOB proof request
* Added `vcx_health_check` call that queries Verity instance to see if it is alive.
* Minor bugfix

## 0.10.1
* Fixed deadlock that may have happened when VCX of 0.9.4/1.10.0 versions was used via NodeJS.
* Corrected building of an Android aar artifact for armeabi-v7a architecture.
* Changed `get_provision_token` function to return token as JSON string value instead of void.
* Aries Invite Action Protocol:
    * Added `vcx_connection_send_invite_action` function which prepares and sends a message to invite another side to take a particular action.
* Updated VCX Aries message threading handling to use `@id` of the first message as thread id (thid) only if that first message doesn't contain `thid`.
* Bugfixes

## 0.10.0

* Added `vcx_credential_reject` function to explicitly reject Aries Credential Offer by sending a ProblemReport message.
* Added `vcx_delete_credential` function to delete Credential from the wallet.
* Supported Aries Question Answer Protocol:
    * added `vcx_connection_send_answer` which prepares and sends the answer on the received question.
* Partial support of Out-of-Band Aries protocol:
    * Sender - Added `vcx_connection_create_outofband` function which prepares Connection object containing Out-of-Band invitation.
               The parameter `handshake` specifies whether the Sender wants to establish a regular connection using connections handshake protocol or create a public channel.
               Next when you called `vcx_connection_connect` Connection state machine either goes by regular steps or transit to Accepted state when no handshake requested.

    * Received - Added `vcx_connection_create_with_outofband_invitation` function which accepts Out-of-Band invitation.
                 If invitation contains `handshake_protocols` connection goes regular flow else transits to Completed state.
    * HandshakeReuse - Added `vcx_connection_send_reuse` function to send HandshakeReuse message.
    * request~attach:
        * Sender - It can be set into Out-of-Band invitation but VCX Issuance and Presentation state machines are not compatible with that protocol.
        * Receiver - User should start attached process once Connection is established.
* Add a helper function to download a single message from the Agency by the given id `vcx_agency_download_message`.
* Changed the logic for updating the status of the messages on the Agency (for Aries protocol only):
    * vcx_*_update_state - still update messages state on agency internally.
    * vcx_*_update_state_with_message - caller has full control, passes messages, and is also responsible to update states in agency.
* Updated handling of `~thread` decorator for Aries messages to track and set `sender_order` and `received_orders` fields.
* Updated building of DIDDoc to set `id` field according to W3C RFC.
* Adopted Aries `Problem Report` message for `issue-credential` and `present-proof` protocols.
    Previous VCX versions send general `Problem Report` messages from `notification` message family in case an error occurred in Issuance and Presentation protocols.
    VCX 0.10.0 sets appropriate `issue-credential`/`present-proof` message family while sending `Problem Report` message.
* Put `institution_logo_url` into Aries Connection invitation as `profileUrl` field.
* Added separate function for Pool initialization.
    Now we can deffer connecting to the Pool Ledger during library initialization(to decrease the time taken) by omitting `genesis_path` field in the config JSON.
    Next, we can use `vcx_init_pool` function (for instance as a background task) to perform a connection to the Pool Ledger.
* Added helper function `vcx_fetch_public_entities` to fetch public entities from the ledger.
    This function performs two steps:
        1) Retrieves the list of all credentials stored in the opened wallet.
        2) Fetch and cache Schemas / Credential Definitions / Revocation Registry Definitions correspondent to received credentials from the connected Ledger.
    This helper function can be used, for instance as a background task, to refresh library cache.
* Updated VCX library to make payment plugin optional dependency. We can omit installation of payment plugin in case we are not going to use payments for our application.

* Bugfixes:
    * Connection handles in Aries state machines can't be serialized properly.
          Overview: Aries Issuance and Presentation state machines held `connection_handle` as property.
          But actual Connection object matching to handle will be destroyed once the library is unloaded.
          That will break Aries state machines.
          Change:  Updated Aries Issuance and Presentation state machines to embed required connection-related data.
          Consequences: Deserialization for Aries Issuance and Presentation state machines in the intermediate state is broken but will work for Started and Finished.
    * Added check that Credential Offer attributes fully match to Credential Definition. Partially filled credentials cannot be issued.
    * Updated signature of Java API functions to return null (Void type) value for functions that actually do not return any result.
      Consequences: the combination of `exceptionally/thenAccept` function to handle results may treat null as an error.
      Tip: Use `whenComplete` function to proper handling instead of combination `exceptionally/thenAccept`.
    * Fixed custom logger to generate only logs with a set level.
    * Corrected `vcx_download_agent_messages` function to set `msg_ref_id` field for downloaded messages.

  Extended provisioning config to accept optional `did_method` filed. This field should be used to create fully qualified DIDs.
  The format of identifiers used on CredentialIssuance and ProofPresentation will determine based on the type of remote DID.
* Bugfixes

## 0.4.1
* Supported endorsing of transactions in Libvcx.
    * `vcx_*_prepare_for_endorser` - functions for `schema` and `credentialdef` which build transaction and crete internal object in differed state.
    * `vcx_*_update_state` and `vcx_*_get_state` - functions to update/get state of `schema`/`credentialdef` internal object.

* Bugfixes

* 0.4.0
* Added a set of new APIs around credentials and proofs that work with messages that should be exchanged without handling the transport of those messages.
This removes the dependency on an agency/cloud-agent and allows the user of the SDK to transport those messages themselves.
There are two types of functions:
    * `vcx_*_get_request_msg` - gets a message that can be sent to the specified connection.
    * `vcx_*_update_state_with_message` - checks for any state change from the given message and updates the state attribute.
* Added new *EXPEREMENTAL* functions to get requirements and price for a ledger request.
    * `vcx_get_request_price` - returns request minimal request price for performing an action in case the requester can do it.
* Updated Indy-SDK CI/CD pipelines to test, to build and to publish Android artifacts for Libvcx.
* Bugfixes:
    * Android Crash upon logging
    * others minor bugfixes

    * Added new `*_update_state_with_message` functions for connections, proofs, cred defs.
    * Bugfixes

* 0.3.0
    * Added new functions to support work with `Transaction Author Agreement` concept.
        * `vcx_get_ledger_author_agreement` to retrieve author agreement and acceptance mechanisms set on the Ledger.
        * `vcx_set_active_txn_author_agreement_meta` to set some accepted agreement as active and to use it for transaction sending.
